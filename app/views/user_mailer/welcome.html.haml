%h3 Hello from the 25c team!

%p We noticed you started using 25c â€” awesome!

%p 25c.com makes it easy for you to <b>make 25c pledges</b> with one click on a network of sites.  Whenever you see the +25c Button regarding something you value highly, click it once to pledge 25 cents; click it twice to pledge 50 cents; etc.  Once you made 40 25c pledges, you will be asked to pay.  You may undo pledges at any time up to the point of payment.

%p If you would like to <b>receive 25c pledges</b>, you can do so in either of these two ways:

%p A) On your own website, blog, etc.: Add a +25c Button using the code & instructions we provide.
%p{ :style => 'margin-bottom:30px;'}= link_to home_buttons_url, home_buttons_url

%p B) On 25c.com: Create a profile page with the +25c Button on it.
%p{ :style => 'margin-bottom:30px;'}= link_to home_profile_url, home_profile_url

%p To get paid, request a pay-out on your Dashboard once you have received a good number of 25c pledges.

%p Keep track of pledges made and received by checking your Dashboard:
%p{ :style => 'margin-bottom:30px;'}= link_to home_dashboard_url, home_dashboard_url

%p If you have any questions along the way, check our FAQ.
%p{ :style => 'margin-bottom:30px;'}= link_to faq_url, faq_url(:ref => "email")

%p Best wishes,
%p The 25c Team
