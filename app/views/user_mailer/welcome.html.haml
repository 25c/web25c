%p{ :style => 'margin-bottom:30px;'} Here are some first steps to start collecting 25c pledges and getting paid:
%p{ :style => 'font-weight: bold;'} 1. You may receive 25c pledges in either of these two ways:

%p A) On your own website, blog, etc.: Add a 25c Button using the code & instructions we provide.
%p{ :style => 'margin-bottom:30px;'}= link_to home_buttons_url, home_buttons_url

%p B) On the 25c website: Create a profile page which has the 25c Button on it right there.
%p{ :style => 'margin-bottom:30px;'}= link_to home_profile_url, home_profile_url

%p{ :style => 'font-weight: bold;'} 2. To get paid for 25c pledges received:

%p Verify your account early because account verification can take up to 7 days, so visit your Account section to get the ball rolling.
