Hello from the 25c team!

We noticed you started using 25c â€” awesome!

Through buttons and links that can be added to any blog and to Pinterest, Youtube, etc., 25c makes it easy for fans to directly support creators they value.  

Whenever you see the +25c Button or the Tip.25c.com Link, click it once to pledge 25 cents; click it twice to pledge 50 cents; and click-hold to increment to larger amounts.

Once you made forty 25c pledges, you will be asked to fund them (by charging $10 to your credit card).  You may undo pledges at any time up to the point of funding.

You can receive 25c pledges on your own website, blog, etc. by adding a +25c Button or a Tip.25c.com Link using the code & instructions we provide.   To get paid, request a pay-out on your Dashboard.

Keep track of pledges made and received by checking your Dashboard at http://www.25c.com

If you have any questions along the way, check our FAQ.

Best wishes,
The 25c Team
