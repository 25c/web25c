Hello from the 25c team!

We noticed you started using 25c â€” awesome!
Here are some first steps to start collecting 25c pledges and getting paid:
1. You may receive 25c pledges in either of these two ways:

A) On your own website, blog, etc.: Add a 25c Button using the code & instructions we provide.

B) On the 25c website: Create a profile page which has the 25c Button on it right there.

2. To get paid for 25c pledges received:

Verify your account early because account verification can take up to 7 days, so visit your Account section to get the ball rolling.
