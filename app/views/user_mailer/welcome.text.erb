Hello from the 25c team!

We noticed you started using 25c â€” awesome!

25c makes it easy for you to make a 25c pledge with one click. Our buttons can be added to any website, blog, photo gallery, or music site.

Whenever you see the +25c Button regarding something you care to support, click it once to pledge 25 cents; click it twice to pledge 50 cents; etc.

Once you made forty 25c pledges, you will be asked to fund them (by charging $10 to your credit card).  You may undo pledges at any time up to the point of funding.

You can receive 25c pledges on your own website, blog, etc. by adding a +25c Button using the code & instructions we provide.   To get paid, request a pay-out on your Dashboard.

Keep track of pledges made and received by checking your Dashboard at http://www.25c.com

If you have any questions along the way, check our FAQ.

Best wishes,
The 25c Team
