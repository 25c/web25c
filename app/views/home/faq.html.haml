  %h2 As a publisher, how do I get paid?
  %p 25c shares a percentage of 70% of its revenue with publishers who provide space for its widgets. After embedding a 25c widget into your content, monitor your dashboard on 25c.com for your share of widget revenue being pledged. Set up a bank connection and obtain your share of revenue through an ACH transfer directly into your bank account.
  %p Creators and publishers, if not the same, may share revenue among themselves using the mechanism provided by 25c.

  %h2 What do you hope to achieve with 25c?
  %p There is a subtle but distinct difference between creating something that attracts tens of millions of viewers valued by an advertiser versus creating something that 10,000 people value high enough to support it directly with a bit of their own money -- if as little as 25 cents.
  %p By adding "value to you" to the financial bottomline of a publisher (besides "value to advertiser"), we hope to incentivize creation of high-quality content that people truly value.
