<h2 class="page-header">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4>What does 25c do?</h4>

<p>25c simplifies social micro-donations. One click, one quarter.

<P>Anyone who has a website, blog, photo collection, video can easily embed a customized +25c Button (or link) and start receiving 25c pledges in a breeze.

<p>We don't get in between givers and receivers with complicated schemes: If someone pledges 25 cents to someone, that's exactly what the receiver will obtain (minus processing fees).  Quarter by quarter.

<h4>How does it work?</h4>

As a backer, you may make forty (40) 25c pledges at their leisure.  Then we ask you to fund them through a (non-refundable) $10 charge to your credit card.

<P>Once funded, a 25c pledge is eligible for pay-out to the receiver. 

<P>People may undo their pledges at any time up to the point of funding them.

<P>Once you are set up for receiving micro-collections, we pay them out to you quarter by quarter into your bank account if you like -- our implementation makes this possible.

<h4>What is the catch?</h4>

<p>There is no downside, only upside for collecting 25c's.  It is purely incremental income. Plus being a top receiver makes you additionally stand out.</p>

<h4>What are the fees?</h4>

<p>See our <a href="fees">Fees</a> page.  As a company, we are committed to providing a low-cost utility.</p>

<h4>Does the +25c Button work like the Facebook "Like" button?</h4>

<p>Our +25c Button essentially combines the functionality of a 'Like' button with that of a 25-cent pledge and integrated payment processing.</p>

<p>The Facebook 'Like' button is being clicked more than three billion times every day by people around the world.  A discriminating fraction of these endorsements can now carry 25-cent pledges.</p>

<h4>Can I pledge 50 cents or more?</h4>

<p>Yes, by repeatedly clicking the same +25c Button.  You can click the +25c Button very rapidly in sequence -- our software was carefully designed to enable just that.  Click it twice and you pledged 50 cents; etc.</p>

<h4>Can I add a Button with a different per-click amount?</h4>

<p>No.  It's 25 cents or -- via multiple clicks -- multiples thereof.  It's part of making the user experience as simple as possible.  

<h4>Can I undo a 25c pledge I made?</h4>

<P>Yes, no problem. You can undo pledges until you funded them.</p>

<h4>How do I pay?</h4>

<P>We support all major credit cards (and some debit cards). This includes Visa, MasterCard, Discover.  We support users in over 190 countries.</p>

<h4>Do you process payments, transmit money?</h4>

<p>Our payment partners do.  At 25c Inc., we operate a pledge processing service that integrates with the services of licensed money transmitters for payment transfer.   25c Inc. never holds, or transmits, or receives for transmission, any currency, funds, or other value, and does not sell any stored value.  Furthermore, no 25c pledge is ever concealed; all 25c pledges are publicly viewable.</p>

<h4>What patents do you own?</h4>

We own numerous patents regarding "multi-one-click" micro-donations, associated systems designs, as well as techniques and designs for cost-effectively enabling social micro-donations (with such cost being financial as well as regulatory).

<h4>What is the background on 25c?</h4>

<p>There are now so many people online that small change can cause big change.  100,000 times 25 cents is $25,000 after all.

<p>In recent years, people have increasingly become accustomed to making micro-payments online.  iTunes, Zynga, etc. have helped form that habit.

<p>People desire to express their gratuity and appreciation for quality they value.  It must be simple to do though.  +25c is our first idea on that -- focused on providing a simple utility that mostly gets out of the way.</p>

<h4>What do you hope to achieve with 25c?</h4>

<P>We hope to help shift the economic basis for providers incrementally towards incentivizing for "value to you" more than "value to a third party".  Value to an advertiser (whether in the form of high-quantity page views or "high-value" users) is just not the same as "value to you". 

<P>There is a subtle but distinct difference in creating something that attracts ten million viewers valued by an advertiser in just the same way they value another ten million viewers elsewhere -- or creating something that gets just 10,000 people to click '+25c'.

<p>Quality media support and drive the quality of our social decision making and ultimately our societal well being.  In that sense, there is no more important project than incentivizing quality media.
