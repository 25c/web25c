<h4>What does 25c do?</h4>

<p>25c is the best way to give and receive tips online.  

<P>There is no $1 minimum for a tip because that's often too large. With 25c, tips as small as 25 cents are processed -- in fact all the way into your bank account (courtesy of Dwolla).

<P>Giving tips is as easy as "one click" -- just a Facebook or Google login is required.  No high-overhead login is required with a payment service or banking system.  Through "Pledge Now, Pay Later", you end up collecting more support.  

<P>Anyone who has a website, blog, Pinterest board or Youtube can easily embed their own +25c Button (or link) and start receiving 25c pledges in a breeze.

<p>We don't get in between givers and receivers with complicated schemes: If someone pledges 25 cents to someone, that's exactly what the receiver will obtain (minus processing fees).  Quarter by quarter.

<h4>How does it work?</h4>

<P>As a backer, you may make forty 25c pledges at your leisure.  Simply click ahead.   You may undo your pledges at any time up to the point of funding them.

<P>Then we ask you to fund your 25c pledges through a (non-refundable) $10 charge to your credit card. Once funded, a 25c pledge is eligible for pay-out. 

<P>As a receiver, once you are set up, we pay out tips to you quarter by quarter into your bank account if you like -- our implementation makes this possible (courtesy of <a target=other href=http://www.dwolla.com>Dwolla</a>).

<h4>What is the catch?</h4>

<p>There is no downside, only upside for collecting 25c's.  It is purely incremental income. Plus being a top giver or receiver makes you additionally stand out.</p>

<h4>What are the fees?</h4>

<p>See our <a href="fees">Fees</a> page.  As a company, we are committed to providing a low-cost utility.</p>

<h4>Can I pledge more than 25 cents?</h4>

<p>Yes, by repeatedly clicking the same +25c Button.  Or by holding down the +25c Button you accelerate a counter of your tip amount.

<h4>Can I undo a 25c pledge I made?</h4>

<P>Yes, no problem. You can undo pledges until you fund them.</p>

<h4>Can I add a Button with a different per-click amount?</h4>

<p>No.  It's 25 cents or -- via multiple clicks or mouse-down -- multiples thereof.  It's part of making the user experience as simple as possible.  

<h4>How do I pay?</h4>

<P>We support all major credit cards (and some debit cards). This includes Visa, MasterCard, Discover.  We support users in over 190 countries.</p>

<h4>How do I get paid?</h4>

After embedding the +25c Button into your content, monitor your dashboard on 25c.com for 25c pledges coming in.  When you have received a good number of 25c pledges, set up the bank connection.  With the bank(s) we are using, we can pay you quarter by quarter if you like.

<h4>Do you process payments, transmit money?</h4>

<p>Our payment partners do.  At 25c Inc., we operate a pledge processing service that integrates with the services of licensed money transmitters for payment transfer.   25c Inc. never holds, or transmits, or receives for transmission, any currency, funds, or other value, and does not sell any stored value.  Furthermore, no 25c pledge is ever concealed; all 25c pledges are publicly viewable.</p>

<h4>What patents do you own?</h4>

We own numerous patents regarding "Like + micro-pay", "multi-one-click" micro-donations, associated systems designs, as well as techniques and designs for cost-effectively enabling social micro-donations (with such cost being financial as well as regulatory).

<h4>What do you hope to achieve with 25c?</h4>

<P>We hope to help shift the economic basis incrementally towards incentivizing creators for "value to you" in addition to -- and/or more than -- "value to an advertiser".  

<P>There is a subtle yet distinct difference in creating something that attracts ten million viewers valued by an advertiser or creating something that 10,000 people value sufficiently to click '+25c'.

<p>Quality media support and drive the quality of our social decision making and ultimately our societal well being.
