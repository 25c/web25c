    %p 25c Inc. simplifies social micro-donations.

    %p 
      Anyone who has a website, blog, or Youtube video can 
      easily embed the +25c Button&trade;  following on our step-by-step
      instructions and immediately start receiving 25c
      pledges.  Those who don't have their own website can also simply create a profile page on 
      25c.com to collect 25c pledges.

    %p 
      The +25c Button empowers people to easily & directly support
      what they value.  Effectively a “Super Like” button, the
      +25c Button combines a "Like" with a 25c pledge.  Or multiples
      thereof because the +25c Button is “multi-one-click”: each click pledges 25 cents.

    %p 
      25c Inc. is a privately held company located in San Francisco,
      California.  Founded by Sylvio Drouin, Lionel Jingles, Francis Li, Ruza
      Markov, and Martin Roscheisen, the company operates a social value graph and micro-payment
      pledge processing service and owns a patent portfolio around social micro-donations.

    %p 
      With our service, we hope to help shift the incentive system towards compensating for 
      "value to a user" more than "value to a third party" (such as advertisers).
