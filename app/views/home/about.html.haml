      %h2 About 25c Inc.
      %p 25c offers widgets that publishers can embed into their website to engage their fans and turn them into direct sponsors.  In a fun way.
      %p Advertising is a good source of income if one's creations attract millions of viewers. But what about the millions of niche content creators whose sites only attract 10,000 people? 25c provides a new solution by enabling fans to directly sponsor the content they love with a bit of their own money â€“ even as little as 25 cents. 
      The result: content creators get paid and fans get more high-quality content.
