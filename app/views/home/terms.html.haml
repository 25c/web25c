    %h3 6. USERS’ USE OF SERVICE

    %p Deposit: Users may load their 25c Jar by purchasing 25c virtual units (“Credit Points”, also called “25c’s”) using their personal credit card at a price per Credit Point of 25 U.S. cents.  The minimum purchase amount is $5 and the maximum is $50.  For example, $5 buy 20 Credit Points. The purchase of Credit Points (“Deposit”) is subject to the 25c Refund Policy (see below), the 25c Payout Policy, and certain fees and expenses.

    %p Starter Deposit: 25c may provide Users with a “free” initial deposit (“Starter Deposit”) of e.g. two Credit Points, in the sole discretion of 25c, to simplify to user experience of their first contributions.  Users may assign Credit Points from this Starter Deposit to participating sites. As soon as a User loads his or her account with a first User deposit, the Starter Deposit is deducted from the User Account.

    %p Donations: Using one or more clicks on the 25c Button, Users may assign their Credit Points to a Provider (“Donation”) whose web content & services they like.  The 25c Button is a patent-pending one-click one-denomination Internet micropayment button, which may be clicked multiple times in sequence, possibly rapidly so, for a corresponding multiple of payment amount. Each click represents the assignment of one Credit Point to the relevant Provider. Clicking the Button once results in a one Credit Point assigned by the User to the Provider of the Button.  Clicking the button twice results in a two Credit Point assignments.  And so on.  Users may click a Button any number of times subject to account limitations managed in the sole discretion by 25c.

    %p To be eligible for Donations, you must (i) have a valid User Account; (ii) have placed funds into your User Account following the relevant instructions on the 25c website.  Users may load their User Account with funds held in foreign denominations but all usage is denominated in U.S. cents and all transaction fees are the User’s responsibility.

    %p Users’ Donation to a Provider is determined by the aggregate number of clicks on Buttons controlled by said Provider that Users have made on Provider controlled web pages.  25c agrees to pay each Provider based on the number of Donations made by Users to a Provider, upon Provider request and subject to a minimum amounts and subject to fees and expenses (see below).

    %p Transaction Fees: Any fees, foreign exchange or penalties charged by any payment providers or processors in relation to the Deposit amount are the User’s sole responsibility.

    %p Cancellations and Refunds: Users may undo individual Donations up to 180 days after they made them.  There is no fee or expense for undoing Donations.  Users may revoke the unused part of their Deposit up to 180 days after they made it subject to a $15 “restocking” fee.

    %p NO REFUNDS AND NO REDEMPTION: THERE ARE NO REFUNDS AND NO REDEMPTION OF THE AMOUNTS PURCHASED WITH 25C (“USER DEPOSIT”) EXCEPT AS DETERMINED BY 25C AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION.  AMOUNTS PLACED IN A USER ACCOUNT CANNOT BE WITHDRAWN.

    %p Auto-Recharge: (a) The Auto-Recharge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy 25c Credit Points, unless you untick the appropriate box. Your Credit Points balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when you first sign up for Auto-Recharge, unless you subsequently change the amount by accessing your User Account. In future the same amount will be charged to your credit card every time your 25c account balance goes below the threshold set by 25c from time to time. If you do not want to enable Auto-Recharge, please untick the box. (b) You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing your User Account.

    %p Invalid Chargebacks: In the event that you initiate a formal chargeback request with your bank or credit card provider and in the event that subsequent investigation determines such chargeback request to be unjustified, in order to cover automatic 25c expenses resulting from this, you agree to pay 25c a Chargeback Admin Fee of $30 and authorize 25c to charge you for it.

    %p Inactive Accounts: If you do not use your 25c Credit Points for a period of 300 days, 25c will place your User Account on inactive status and your 25c Credit Points expire. You can reactivate your User Account by following the reactivation link athttps://www.25c.com/account/credit-reactivate.

You are not permitted to use any 25c Credit Points on or after the date of its expiry.

    %p User Account Termination: A User cannot voluntarily suspend his User Account. Your User Account and activity will remain viewable: Even after a User Account has been terminated or suspended, any previous 25c activity will be viewable by all Users for historical financial tracking and other purposes. 25c reserves the right to store and share all 25c donating activity subject to the Privacy Policy.

    %h3 7. PROVIDERS’ USE OF SERVICE

    %p Each Provider acknowledges and agrees that the Buttons are provided by a non-exclusive license, and not sold or transferred, as part of the Service and that he will not use them for any use other than his permitted use of the Service. There is no cost to license Buttons but their use is subject to these Terms and a Provider may only use and display a Button if he has a valid User Account.  Each Button has a unique tracking code. A Provider may (i) duplicate and install it with the same tracking code either throughout his or her website, which may include but is not limited to a website, blog or service, or across his websites, or (ii) use separate Buttons with unique tracking codes for different pages or sections of his website(s). Each Provider agrees that 25c acts as a trustee pursuant to these Terms. Providers provide 25c with information regarding their Designated Account defined as a checking bank account held with a commercially acceptable banking institution.

    %p No Misguiding: The name of a website a Provider chooses to assign to a Button must be consistent with the actual webpage where the Button is displayed and must not be an attempt to mislead users or visitors into thinking the website is a different website or that the Button is associated with a different website. If a Provider installs a Button on his website, he warrants that he or the entity he is legally authorized to represent owns or has been granted the appropriate license to all intellectual property rights relating to his website, including but not limited to the rights relating to the content of the website.

    %p All rights, titles and interests in and to any Button, including but not limited to all intellectual property rights, are the exclusive property of 25c.

    %p Payout: Upon Provider request, provided a Provider has reached a minimum aggregate number of 200 Credit Points in User Donations, such minimum amount determined in the sole discretion of 25c, Provider is eligible to receive Proceeds (as defined below) from 25c.

    %p Proceeds: Proceeds are based on Credit Points that, using the Service, Users have assigned to a Provider, not including any Starter Deposit, and are subject to Fees and Expenses (as defined below).  Proceeds are a gross amount of 20 U.S. cents per Credit Point assigned to a Provider by a User. Net proceeds are gross proceeds minus transaction fees and minus any applicable Referrer Fee (as defined below).  If a User utilized the 25c Short-URL Service, such utilization resulting in the assignment of one or more Credit Points to Provider (“Referred Assignments”), Referrer earns a Referrer Fee in the amount of 5 U.S. cents per Credit Point received in a Referred Assignment, such amount to be deducted from the Net Proceeds to the Provider. 25c will not pay for any payment processing fees, including but not limited to the fees associated with collecting money from 25c Users, disbursing the 25c Proceeds and any currency conversion, and, if necessary, any such fees will be deducted from the relevant 25c Proceeds prior to the Allocation. 25c reserves the right to vary the 25c Fees at any time.

    %p Disbursement of Proceeds: Subject to meeting the minimum amount of $50 in Proceeds, Proceeds will be disbursed on the first business day following the 10thday of the month that follows the date of a Provider’s disbursement request (“Disbursement Date”) for any Credit Points assigned to the Provider up to 180 days before the Disbursement Date.

    %p Any movement of funds and any disbursements by 25c may be subject to compliance, regulatory or anti-money laundering requirements and as such may be subject to delays. 25c will try to ensure that the Provider’s Designated Account is credited with Proceeds in accordance with these Terms within ten (10) business days of the date of the relevant Allocation.

    %p Breaching the Agreement: 25c reserves the right to withhold Proceeds or other amounts due to a Provider if there is any suspected breach of these Terms by the Provider, pending reasonable investigation by 25c.

    %p In the event that a Provider’s 25c User Account is terminated and subject to these Terms, 25c will disburse to the Provider’s Designated Account all 25c Proceeds accumulated in the Provider’s 25c User Account that have not been allocated as 25c Amounts less any amounts due to 25c as 25c Fees or otherwise.

    %p Tax Obligations: 25c is not responsible for the reporting, collection, calculation or payment of any taxes applicable to 25c Users or Providers whatsoever. Each 25c User and Provider is solely responsible for the collection and payment of any such taxes and for the provision and maintenance of all necessary information and records associated with their 25c User Accounts.

    %p Maintenance of the Designated Account: It is the sole responsibility of the Provider to maintain updated and correct contact information and provide a valid and active Designated Account for receiving disbursements. Failure to do so will relieve 25c of any obligation to disburse the Provider’s 25c Proceeds. If such information is not updated for a period of six (6) months or more, the Provider is deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that 25c may without further notice disburse to one or more charities or other non-profit organizations of 25c’s choice any 25c Proceeds accumulated in the Provider’s 25c User Account that have not been allocated as 25cing Amounts less any amounts due to 25c as 25c Fees or otherwise and less any fees that may arise on disbursement.

    %p Suspending or Cancelling a Button by Providers: Buttons cannot be cancelled since they contain historical traffic and financial information that must be preserved. However, a Provider may remove a Button from any or all of his pages for any reason and at any time. This involves deleting the Button’s JavaScript, static HTML code or similar programming from the website. When a Provider removes a Button from his website, the listing and button on the 25c website may not be removed automatically. To ensure they are removed, the Provider must use the “delete thing” function found on the 25c website.  Providers and Users understand and agree that any historical activity and information of any Provider’s website will not be removed from the 25c Service.

    %h3 8. REFERRERS’ USE OF SERVICE

    %p Using the 25c Short-URL service, a User (“Referrer”) may direct other users to pages that contain the 25c Button by a Provider.  If a referred user makes a Donation subsequent to such referral, Referrer will receive a referral bonus in the amount of 5 U.S. cents per Credit Point assigned to the Provider on the referred page.  Referrers must create a Provider account with 25c in order to create 25c Short URLs and receive bonus payments.

    %h3 9. 25C PRIVACY POLICY
